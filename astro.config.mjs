/**
 * Rewrite base-prefixed absolute asset URLs to page-relative ones.
 *
 * Astro writes `<script src="/comp4020-crit5-attwelveDev/_astro/x.js">`, which
 * is right on the deployed project page and unresolvable anywhere else. CI's
 * links check crawls the built `dist/` as a flat directory, so that URL points
 * at `dist/comp4020-crit5-attwelveDev/_astro/x.js`, which does not exist, and
 * the check fails on a site that is actually fine once deployed.
 *
 * Making the URLs relative fixes the check by making the local build and the
 * deployed build genuinely equivalent, rather than by teaching the check to
 * ignore a difference. It is also what this repo's original Vite config did
 * (`base: "./"`), which Astro has no direct equivalent for.
